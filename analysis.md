## SQL Practice (2025-12-16)

### Objective
To identify patients with poor glycemic control and explore differences
in HbA1c levels by smoking status.

### Query 1: Patients with HbA1c ≥ 7.0
This query extracts patients whose HbA1c is 7.0 or higher,
which is commonly used as a threshold for poor glycemic control.

### Query 2: Average HbA1c by Smoking Status
Among patients with HbA1c ≥ 7.0, I calculated the average HbA1c
by smoking status. I focused on groups with an average HbA1c of 7.5 or higher
to identify potentially higher-risk populations.

### Reflection
This exercise helped me practice filtering, aggregation, and HAVING clauses,
while connecting SQL logic to clinical insights from my nursing experience.

**Limitations / Next Steps:** The current analysis is exploratory, and future work will include additional variables and implementation in Python.
